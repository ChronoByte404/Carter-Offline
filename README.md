<h2> Carter-Offline </h2>

This program is an Artificial Intelligence algorithm, which learns from your input and Carter's responses to generate new and unique responses each time it is trained.

It is powered by PyTorch, and provides you with an API interface.

This is a highly stripped-back version of my personal AI project, which will hopefully allow for beginners to learn the basics of Machine Learning and personal assistant creating.

## How to Install

```
pip install Carter-Offline
```
