# Sanware Carter MK 0.1

This program is an Artificial Intelligence algorithm, which learns from your input and Carter's responses to generate new and unique responses each time it is trained.

It is powered by PyTorch, and provides you with multiple interfaces - Tkinter, Discord (through the nextcord library), Terminal, and more!

This is a highly stripped-back version of my personal AI project, which will hopefully allow for beginners to learn the basics of Machine Learning and personal assistant creating.

## How to Install

1. I have created an installer program which you'll need to run before anything else, to ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. SanwareAutoInstaller.py

2. You will need your Carter agent token and agent name to then insert into the ai_config.py file.

3. After that, enjoy using your own Jarvis (or whatever name you've chosen) in Tkinter, Discord, or Command line!
